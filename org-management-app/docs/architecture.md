# Architecture of the Organization & Users Management Application

## Overview
The Organization & Users Management application is a full-stack solution designed to manage user authentication and organization data efficiently. It leverages modern technologies and best practices to ensure a robust and scalable architecture.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (managed via Prisma ORM)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose, Nginx

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend
The frontend is built using Next.js, which provides server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities. The structure includes:
- **Pages**: Contains the main application routes such as login, dashboard, and organization management.
- **Components**: Reusable UI components for authentication and organization management.
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for managing state and side effects.
- **API Library**: Functions for making API calls to the backend.

### 2. Backend
The backend is structured around an Express server, which handles API requests and business logic. Key components include:
- **Controllers**: Manage incoming requests and responses for authentication, users, and organizations.
- **Services**: Contain business logic for user and organization management, including authentication processes.
- **Middlewares**: Handle authentication checks and error management.
- **Models**: Define the data structure and relationships using Prisma.

### 3. Database
The application uses PostgreSQL as the database, with the schema defined in Prisma. This allows for easy migrations and type-safe database queries.

### 4. Containerization
The application is containerized using Docker, with separate Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend. Docker Compose is used to orchestrate the services, ensuring that the application can be easily deployed and scaled.

### 5. Nginx
Nginx is configured to serve static files and route API requests to the backend, providing a layer of abstraction and improving performance.

## Security
The application implements professional authentication mechanisms, including:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions.
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Additional Features
- **User Roles**: Support for different user roles and permissions.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability across various devices.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a solid foundation for the Organization & Users Management application, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and security. The use of modern technologies and best practices positions the application for future growth and feature enhancements.
